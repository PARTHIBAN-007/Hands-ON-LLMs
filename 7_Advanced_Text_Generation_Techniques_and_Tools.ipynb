It is an irrational number, meaning it cannot be expressed exactly as a fraction and its decimal representation never ends or repeats. Pi has significance across various fields, including geometry, trigonometry, physics, engineering, and statistics due to the ubiquity of circular shapes and wave-like phenomena in nature.\\n\\nCurrent conversation: Human: How do I calculate my age using Python?\\nAI: To calculate your current age in years using Python, you need a reference date (e.g., today's date) and the date when you were born.
